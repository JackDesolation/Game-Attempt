This will just be something i work on for fun, if it works out well i'll probably make a more in depth, and monetized version. A source of income could be cool but at the same time i'd realistically only be able to charge 5$ at max.


This game will be about starting with only carbon, making oyur way through the periodic table, and then buying a collider to try to make new elements, with traits based off of what you put in the collider (IT CAN AND WILL GET UNREALISTIC AFTER A LONG TIME OF PLAYING)
